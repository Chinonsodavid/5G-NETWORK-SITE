                                 If you can't convince them, confuse them. An efficient telecommunications network is the foundation
                                upon which an information society is built. The key is the Internet.The United States is by far the most advanced country in this new digital culture, so we have to be there.
                                 The Internet is the heart of this new civilization, and telecommunications are the nervous system,
                                  or circulatory system.</p>

                            the mentality with which many presumably educated, intelligent people approach matters of economics and business is, however astonishing it may seem,
                             still that of the Dark Ages. I urge telecommunications regulators to develop a commercial strategy for delivering effective access to the continent.</p>

                            all those things that will help lower the cost and increase the ease of doing business across the region.We expect 5G to become the worldwide dominating mobile communications standard of the next decade.
                            Connected cars will shape the future of individual mobility, and next generation 
                            mobile networks will take car to x connectivity to a new level. 5G networks are fundamentally different to 4G networks</p>
